## 📌 Challenge Details

### 🔹 1. BMI Calculator

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using JavaScript.

#### ✅ Objective

Write a function that returns one of the following messages depending on the BMI result:

- BMI < 18.5 → `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."`
- BMI between 18.5–24.9 → `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."`
- BMI > 24.9 → `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."`

### 🗓️ 2. Leap Year Checker

This simple JavaScript function checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
It follows the standard leap year rules:

    A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100,
    unless it's also divisible by 400.

Includes test cases to demonstrate how it works.

This simple JavaScript function picks a random person from a list to pay for lunch.

**How it works:**
- Takes a list of names.
