## üöÄ Challenge List (JavaScript)

1. [Buid a BMI Calculator](./bmiCalculator.js)  
   - A JavaScript function that calculates BMI and returns a message based on the result.
2. [Leap Year Checker](./leapYear.js)
   - A JavaScript function checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
3. [Who's Buy Lunch Today? Code Challange](./whosBuyLunch.js)
   - A JavaScript function picks a random person from a list to pay for lunch.
4. [99 Bottles Lyrics Challange](./nineNineBottle.js)
   - A JavaScript program that counts down from 99 to 1, printing the traditional "99 Bottles of Beer" song lyrics with proper singular/plural grammar handling and the classic ending verse.
5. [Fibonacci Generator Function](./fibonacciGenerator.js)
   - A JavaScript function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and returns them as an array.

## üìå Challenge Details

### üîπ 1. BMI Calculator

A simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator using JavaScript.

#### ‚úÖ Objective

Write a function that returns one of the following messages depending on the BMI result:

- BMI < 18.5 ‚Üí `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."`
- BMI between 18.5‚Äì24.9 ‚Üí `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."`
- BMI > 24.9 ‚Üí `"Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."`

### üóìÔ∏è 2. Leap Year Checker

This simple JavaScript function checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.
It follows the standard leap year rules:

    A year is a leap year if it's divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100,
    unless it's also divisible by 400.

Includes test cases to demonstrate how it works.

### üçΩÔ∏è Who's Paying

This simple JavaScript function picks a random person from a list to pay for lunch.

**How it works:**
- Takes a list of names.
- Picks one name at random.
- Returns a message saying who will pay for lunch.

Includes example usage and sample output.

### üç∫ 99 Bottles Lyrics Challange

This JavaScript program that counts down from 99 to 1, printing the traditional "99 Bottles" song lyrics.

**How it works:**

- Counts down from 99 bottles to 1 bottle.
- Handles proper grammar (singular/plural forms).
- Includes the classic ending verse.

Uses while loops, conditionals, and template literals to generate the complete song.

### üî¢ Fibonacci Generator Challenge
This JavaScript function generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and returns them as an array.
How it works:

- Takes a number n as input (how many Fibonacci numbers to generate).
- Handles edge cases for n = 0, 1, and 2.
- Uses iterative approach to build the sequence efficiently.
- Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).

Uses conditional statements, arrays, and for loops to generate complete Fibonacci sequences of any length.
Perfect for GitHub! This matches the style you wanted with the emoji, clear structure, and technical details.
